// what is an array 
// arrays are list 

let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c','f'];
console.log(arr[1],arr[2])

// Declaring arrays 
// we can decalre an empty array 
// const arr = [];
// you can add elements in it 
// we can also declare arrays with element like the example above 

// Tips
// The new Array() method of declaring arrays is older and 
//should not be used very often. 
//You should use brackets instead.

// Arrays can include any type of variable. Strings, numbers, booleans 
//and everything else.

// Use const to declare arrays, even when the values inside change. 
//You can still add, remove and change values inside of an array 
//if you declare it with const, because the actual value of 
// the variable doesn't change. It's still the same array.
